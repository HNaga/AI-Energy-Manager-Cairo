## Current Status: Intelligent Simulation (v1.0)
This is a **fully functional AI simulation** that:
- Uses real Cairo weather data  
- Models AC, lights, fridge, and battery behavior  
- Applies dynamic electricity pricing  
- Recommends optimal schedules using a trained ML model  

**No hardware required** – runs on any laptop  
**Future versions will include real device control** (Sonoff, Tuya, Shelly, smart meters)

## Features (Simulation Mode)
- 100% local – works offline  
- Mobile-first web app (add to home screen → real app feel)  
- Real-time predictions & recommendations  
- Visual dashboard with charts  
- Ready for extension to real hardware
